# Framer `Label` module

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Create a layer that is the intrinsic size (height and width) of the text content
it contains. There is also support for single/multi-line truncation when
constraining the labelâ€™s `width`.

## Usage
```shell
$ cd <myProject>.framer
$ npm install framer-label
```

modules/myModule.coffee:
```coffeescript
exports.Label = require "framer-label"
```

app.coffee:
```javascript
{Label} = require "myModule"

new Label
  text: "My amazing label"
  width: 100
  lineNumber: 2
```

## TODO

- Add `Layer#text` and `Layer#lineNumber` API
