# Framer `Label` module

<img src="screenshot.png" width="273">

Create a layer that is the intrinsic size (height and width) of the text content
it contains. There is also support for single/multi-line truncation.

Check out the [example](http://share.framerjs.com/v9l2rpmlnsju/) or
clone/download this repo, open it in [Framer Studio](http://framerjs.com/)
and play around.

**Note:** This module depends on the beta `Utils.textSize` method, so be sure to
"File > Update Framer&hellip;".

## Usage
```shell
$ cd <myProject>.framer
$ npm install framer-label
```

modules/myModule.coffee:
```coffeescript
exports.Label = require "framer-label"
```

app.coffee:
```javascript
{Label} = require "myModule"

new Label
  text: "One great label"
  lineHeight: 1.5
  lineNumber: 2
  maxWidth: 100
```

## API

### `Layer#lineNumber <number>`
Represents the max number of lines a label can have. This only applies when
there is a constraining `maxWidth` set. Set to `0`, `null` or any other falsey
value to stop truncation and render the label at its inherit height.

### `Layer#maxWidth <number>`
Constrain the labelâ€™s width and truncate any overflowing text. If the `text` is
shorter than the set `maxWidth`, the label will shrink to that inherit
size.

### `Layer#text <string>`
The text (and/or HTML) to display.

### `Layer#<css-typography-property>`
All the [CSS typography properties][CSS props] are `Label` properties as well. No need
to `myLabel.style.lineHeight = 1.5`.
